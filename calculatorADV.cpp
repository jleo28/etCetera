//Hi! As part of a self-paced course in tinkering with my C++ skills, I'll be attempting to write code for a Complex Calculator in C++.
//I'll be writing the base code here on Github, but I'll be running parallel tests on VSCode.
//The reason I'm doing this is just to get a better feel for continuous workflow on Github ^-^.
